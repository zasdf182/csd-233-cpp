# Binary Trees and Linked Lists

### Similarities

-   Both use nodes, or objects that point to other objects, that are meant to be traversed in order to find a specific value within the entire collection.
-   In both, the input data size does not have to be specified before implementation.

### Differences

-   A binary tree has many branching paths, unlike a linked list, which only has one linear path.
-   Searching a binary tree is faster, at O(log(n)) time, compared to a linked list, which is O(n) time.
-   In a binary tree, data values are usually sorted. In a linked list, data values don't have to be sorted.
